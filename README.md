# New York City 2021 Graduation Rate Analysis
by: Tenicka Norwood

# Data Understanding

For over two decades, the New York State Performance Standards Consortium has focused on in-depth literacy, problem solving, research and methodolgy as a more holistic representation of student performance.  The consortium serves around 12,000 students in New York State and has a waiver from the majority of Regents exams.  Within this project, I will analyze the graduation outcomes for subgroups students in Consortium Schools and compare those outcomes to New York City Public Schools according to data hosted by the NYSED and on NYC Open Data.

# Importing appropriate libraries and visualization packages 

Building code that is modular and easy to use depends on being able to leverage libraries and visualization packages to access useful code in a way that is efficient and easily reproducible.  In particular the folowing libaries:
* <code> pandas </code>                
* <code> numpy </code>                
* <code> seaborn </code>             
* <code> matplotlib </code>
